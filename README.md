# Computational Physics Final Project

In the third year of my physics degree, we studied the Ising model and used numerical simulations in C to model the behaviour of the model under different boundary conditions. My final project for this class investigated the effects of various boundary conditions on the 2-D (lattice) Ising model. Numerical simulations were done in C with data processing and analysis done in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

Technologies and skills used: Python (NumPy, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks), C, numerical simulations, pseudo-random number generators.
